	<h1>The Green Square on GitHub Pages</h1>
	<p>Josh Rehman 2015/10/18</p>
	<p>The green square is my version of hello world - it just means to put a green square on the screen.</p>
	<p>In this case, I'm going to just use a div:</p>
	<div class="green square"></div>
	<p>What I learned:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Github makes a distinction between a user and a project page. The user page is created by selecting a special repo name; the project page is created with a specially named branch. Both only require the presence of index.html in the root of the repo.</li>
		<li>For project pages, if you don't select gh-pages as the default branch then you'll have to keep merging into </li>
		<li>It's possible to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">use a custom domain name</a>.</li>
	</ol>
